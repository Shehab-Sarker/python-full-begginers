What is Variable?
→→→Variables are Likes boxes. Just as water can be stored in a 
box ,objects can be stored in it,variables can also store many
things (values). There is an equal sign (=) between the variable 
and its value. The left side of this symbol is the variable and 
the right is the value. The value given on the right is stored 
in the variable on the left, called an assignment.
